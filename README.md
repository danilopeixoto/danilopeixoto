# Hello World!

As a software engineer, I employ functional, generic, and object-oriented programming to create performance and reliable applications to empower artists and scientists in their work.

My primary areas of interest include computer graphics, computer vision, physics-based simulation, distributed computing, compiler design, and programming languages.

I aim to inspire other team members with creative solutions from the knowledge I have gathered through various sources such as reading nature, user experience, research papers, or an arbitrary open-source library.

By compiling these collections of observed patterns, we can effectively take action, resolve intricate problems and generate novel solutions with outcomes.
